# Commarc.Interface
Contract class for my Commarc Apps, but you can use for free in your own apps.
Please, think of give me a credits, it's enough for me.

Until this moment, my contract class has just Data or Repository tier.
Next, when application will be updated, I can improve this code.

Fell free to make sugestions and help improve here also.
